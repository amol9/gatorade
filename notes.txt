I have started on a project here. The idea is to build a web-app which would have a frontend to rate various energy drinks. There would be a backend to store the ratings. This will be the first part. The second part will be to display the summary of the data collected.

The rating will gather the following data.

Taste
Color
Smell
Zing
Refreshment level
Availability

Other Information

Company

BF/GF
Spouse
Colleagues
Alone

Place

Home
Cafe
Mall
Vehicle

There is a thought, to use checkboxes to collect the data.
